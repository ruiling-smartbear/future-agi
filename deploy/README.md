# Production deployment

This directory holds the production overlay for self-hosted Future AGI on Docker Compose. It layers on the **Distributed** setup in `docker-compose.distributed.yml` at the repo root, which is geared for local evaluation with safe defaults; this overlay re-binds required secrets with `${VAR:?error}` guards so compose refuses to boot on dev fallbacks. The **Standalone** setup (`docker-compose.yml`) has no production overlay, and Kubernetes has its own path, the [Helm chart](helm/futureagi/README.md). See [Deployment modes](../INSTALLATION.md#deployment-modes).

Before you start:

- Every setting, its default and what breaks when it is wrong: [docs/configuration.md](../docs/configuration.md). Work through its [minimal production checklist](../docs/configuration.md#minimal-production-checklist).
- What an install sends to Future AGI, and how to turn it off (`FUTURE_AGI_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=true` in `deploy/.env.production`): [docs/telemetry.md](../docs/telemetry.md).
- The images, their tags and how to verify one: [docs/images.md](../docs/images.md).

## Quickstart

First prepare configuration without starting services. The script preserves an
existing environment file byte-for-byte; it never regenerates its credentials.
For a new file it preserves explicitly supplied application secrets, generating
only missing ones. Catalog reader/writer passwords and all seven reviewed
application/collector/runner image versions must be supplied explicitly.
For retained data with a missing environment file, restore the original configuration
instead of generating new application or catalog credentials.

```bash
./deploy/setup.sh --skip-up
```

After the initialization prerequisite below has been independently satisfied:

```bash
./deploy/setup.sh --confirm-initialized
```

`--confirm-initialized` is an operator acknowledgement, not proof of initialization.
The existing check-only startup jobs still validate the actual schema/mirror state.
`--non-interactive` preserves an existing file; for a new one it requires explicit
`FRONTEND_URL`, `VITE_HOST_API`, all image versions listed below and both catalog-password
inputs. Missing required input or closed stdin fails instead of looping. Optional
provider-key prompts disable terminal echo; supplied provider keys are preserved. Supply
secrets through a protected environment/file, not command-line arguments or logs.
New prompted values are single-line; existing operator-managed dotenv files are
validated by Compose without being shell-sourced or rewritten.
Setup clears ambient application/catalog/provider secret and credential-path
overrides before Compose reads the file, so an export cannot silently replace an
installed credential. New supplied values are saved with Compose-safe quoting
(including dollar signs, quotes and trailing backslashes). Update
missing entries explicitly with the existing values; do not regenerate the file.

Manual flow (only after the same prerequisite; do not copy over an existing file):

```bash
cp deploy/.env.production.example deploy/.env.production
# fill in REQUIRED values; use the installed credentials for retained data
docker compose --env-file deploy/.env.production \
  -f docker-compose.distributed.yml -f deploy/docker-compose.production.yml config --quiet
docker compose --env-file deploy/.env.production \
  -f docker-compose.distributed.yml -f deploy/docker-compose.production.yml pull
docker compose --env-file deploy/.env.production \
  -f docker-compose.distributed.yml -f deploy/docker-compose.production.yml up -d --no-build --wait --wait-timeout 1200
```

If any required value is empty, compose exits with `must be set for production` and names the missing var.

## Prerequisites

- Docker Engine 24.0+ and Docker Compose v2.24+
- A reverse proxy that terminates TLS in front of the frontend (Caddy / nginx / Traefik / ALB)
- (Optional) Managed Postgres and S3-compatible object store if you don't want the bundled `postgres` / `minio` containers
- 4+ vCPU and 12–16 GB RAM on the host (ClickHouse and the worker each hold ~1 GB); the stack boots in 6 GB, which is enough for a smoke test only

### Required initialization boundary

Production is **check-only**, not a fresh-database installer. Before boot, a
separately approved initialization/upgrade must have established current PostgreSQL
migrations, native ClickHouse objects, the two isolated observed indexes and their
reader/writer grants, and compatible PeerDB namespace/peers/mirrors. All source and
native database routing must match. See [the native bootstrap contract](../fi-collector/PROPERTY_CATALOG_OSS.md).

The overlay runs `migrate --check --noinput`, observed-index `--check`, and native/
CDC/PeerDB checks without `--apply`. Missing or incompatible state must block boot;
a compatible in-progress snapshot has a bounded readiness wait. Neither setup nor
this guide runs initialization, replaces mirrors, rewrites sources, or grants
migration authority. Do not remove these guards or run the mutating root-only
Compose stack as a production workaround. Retain partial state after a failed check
and review the exact failed job before explicitly resuming.

### Performing that initialization (first install)

The prohibition above is on using the mutating root stack as a _workaround_ — on
letting `up` apply schema implicitly. It is not a prohibition on initializing at
all. A first install has to run these jobs once, deliberately, one at a time,
reviewing each before the next.

Run them against the production env file, overriding only the command so each job
applies instead of checking. `run --rm` starts one job and nothing else; it never
brings up the application.

```bash
cd <repo root>
COMPOSE="docker compose --env-file deploy/.env.production \
  -f docker-compose.distributed.yml -f deploy/docker-compose.production.yml"

# 1. PostgreSQL schema, system evals and Temporal schedules.
#    Run the image's own entrypoint with SERVICE_TYPE=bootstrap rather than a
#    hand-written `manage.py migrate`: the bootstrap path is what also seeds
#    system evals and registers Temporal schedules, and ordinary startup now
#    deliberately does neither. All three overrides are required; together
#    they are the explicit operator authorization -- the overlay pins this job to
#    `migrate --check` with NO_STARTUP_DB_MUTATIONS=true, and both the
#    entrypoint and Django's own startup guard refuse a bare `migrate` without
#    them.
$COMPOSE run --rm \
  -e SERVICE_TYPE=bootstrap \
  -e STARTUP_DB_MUTATION_MODE=operator \
  -e NO_STARTUP_DB_MUTATIONS=false \
  --entrypoint bash postgres-schema-bootstrap ./entrypoint.sh

# 2. Native ClickHouse objects.
$COMPOSE run --rm clickhouse-native-bootstrap --phase native --apply

# 3. PeerDB Temporal namespace, then peers and mirrors.
$COMPOSE run --rm peerdb-temporal-init --apply
$COMPOSE run --rm peerdb-init --apply

# 4. CDC-derived objects, once the mirrors above report ready.
$COMPOSE run --rm clickhouse-cdc-bootstrap \
  --phase cdc --apply --wait-for-mirrors --timeout 900

# 5. The two observed indexes and their reader/writer grants.
#    This job takes no --apply flag: the script provisions when given NO
#    arguments and only validates when given --check, and the production
#    overlay pins it to --check. Clearing the command is what makes it apply.
#    It CREATEs a database, tables and two roles, so it needs an administrative
#    ClickHouse login -- the overlay's own CLICKHOUSE_USER is the read-only
#    observed_catalog_reader and cannot provision. Supply your admin credential:
$COMPOSE run --rm \
  -e CLICKHOUSE_USER=<clickhouse admin user> \
  -e CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD=<clickhouse admin password> \
  --entrypoint /bin/sh property-catalog-clickhouse-bootstrap \
  /bootstrap/bootstrap_clickhouse.sh
```

The writer and reader passwords this step installs come from
`PROPERTY_CATALOG_CONSUMER_PASSWORD` and `PROPERTY_CATALOG_API_PASSWORD` in your
env file. They are installed once and never rotated by setup, so for a retained
installation reuse the exact values already in place rather than generating new
ones.

Order matters: PostgreSQL migrations, then native ClickHouse tables, then the
PeerDB snapshot/CDC pair, then the observed indexes. Step 4 depends on step 3's
mirrors existing, which is why it waits rather than assuming.

Step 1 prints the commands it runs. It must reach `migrate`, `seed_system_evals`
and `register_temporal_schedules` and exit 0 with "One-shot database bootstrap
completed successfully"; an install whose step 1 stopped at `migrate` has no
system evals and no registered schedules.

Then boot normally. From that point the overlay is check-only for the lifetime of
the install, and `--confirm-initialized` is your acknowledgement that the steps
above were completed and reviewed:

```bash
./deploy/setup.sh --confirm-initialized
```

Upgrades re-run the same jobs with the same commands. They are idempotent — every
one is a no-op against current state — so a stalled upgrade can be resumed from the
job that failed rather than restarted from step 1.

A retained legacy span mirror from an older `--distributed` install is inspected but
left untouched. Its source/destination identity, mapping and health must still
pass validation; upgrading does not require deleting that mirror or its data.

### Upgrading an existing install: backfill before you cut over

**This release changes where custom-attribute suggestions come from, and the change
is not self-healing.**

Previously `dashboard/metrics` and `dashboard/filter_values` served custom-attribute
keys and values by scanning spans, because the catalog read path was gated off by
default (`PROPERTY_CATALOG_READ_MODE=off`). That gate is gone: both endpoints now
read the observed indexes exclusively, and those indexes contain only what has been
ingested since they were created.

An existing installation with empty observed indexes initially has no historical
custom-attribute suggestions. Live ingestion fills them from the moment the new
collector runs; earlier observations require a backfill or validated legacy
import. Suggestions stay usable as they arrive, with no user-facing coverage
notice. This does not disable actual filtering over the source records.

`query_complete: true` means the requested index page was read successfully, not
that all retained history has been indexed. The API keeps `query_exact: false`;
an empty page or exhausted cursor is not backfill-completion evidence. Pickers
do not probe source spans, infer coverage from the oldest observation, or require
an arrival-time index. Actual catalog read failures still return errors.

Run the span backfill for each project over your retention window before you rely
on the new pickers.

The backfill binary does not reuse the collector's own ClickHouse or PostgreSQL
settings. It reads its span source from `FI_OBSERVED_BACKFILL_CH_*` and verifies
project ownership through `FI_PG_DSN`, and it refuses to start if either is
missing. It also writes its resume checkpoint to a path you supply, and the
collector image runs with a read-only root filesystem, so that path must be a
writable mount that survives `--rm`.

```bash
# Durable, survives --rm, and owned by the image's runtime user (nonroot, uid
# 65532): a root-owned directory is not writable from inside the container.
sudo install -d -o 65532 -g 65532 -m 0750 /var/lib/futureagi/backfill

docker compose --env-file deploy/.env.production \
  -f docker-compose.distributed.yml -f deploy/docker-compose.production.yml \
  run --rm \
  -v /var/lib/futureagi/backfill:/backfill \
  -e FI_OBSERVED_BACKFILL_CH_URL=http://clickhouse:8123 \
  -e FI_OBSERVED_BACKFILL_CH_DATABASE=<the native span database, e.g. $CH25_DATABASE> \
  -e FI_OBSERVED_BACKFILL_CH_USERNAME=<a read-only ClickHouse user on that database> \
  -e FI_OBSERVED_BACKFILL_CH_PASSWORD=<its password> \
  -e FI_PG_DSN="postgres://<pg user>:<pg password>@postgres:5432/<pg db>?sslmode=disable" \
  --entrypoint /usr/local/bin/fi-observed-catalog-backfill fi-collector \
  --source spans \
  --project <project uuid> \
  --since  <RFC3339, e.g. the oldest span you intend to keep filterable> \
  --until  <RFC3339, now> \
  --checkpoint /backfill/<project uuid>.json \
  --apply
```

The source credential only ever runs one bounded `SELECT` per page against the
span table, so give it a read-only login rather than the writer. Kafka
destination and per-span limits are inherited from the `fi-collector` service
environment and need no override.

It takes one project per invocation and pages one hour-bucket at a time, so budget
roughly one page per hour of range and re-run with the same `--checkpoint` to
resume — give each project its own checkpoint file, since a checkpoint is bound to
the exact project, range and Kafka destination that created it. Without `--apply`
it previews and publishes nothing, which is the right way to check scope first.

It replays the **newest hour first** so recent suggestions arrive first. Track
progress through the CLI receipts and checkpoint, not picker metadata. A
completed scan proves publication for that bounded scan; verify consumer offsets
and indexed data separately before claiming migration completion. In particular,
publication receipts deliberately report `consumer_visibility_verified: false`.
Resuming with the same `--checkpoint` is safe; a checkpoint written by an older
oldest-first build is rejected rather than resumed in the wrong direction.

A fresh install needs none of this: there is no history to recover.

## 1. Generate secrets

```bash
SECRET_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
AGENTCC_INTERNAL_API_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
AGENTCC_ADMIN_TOKEN=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
PG_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -hex 16)
MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -hex 16)
# Fernet key for integration credentials stored in Postgres (optional until
# you connect an integration; without it, connecting one fails).
INTEGRATION_ENCRYPTION_KEY=$(python3 -c "import base64, os; print(base64.urlsafe_b64encode(os.urandom(32)).decode())")
```

For a new installation, paste each into `deploy/.env.production`. For retained
installations, reuse the original values: a new `INTEGRATION_ENCRYPTION_KEY`
cannot decrypt credentials stored with the old one. Also supply
`PROPERTY_CATALOG_API_PASSWORD` and `PROPERTY_CATALOG_CONSUMER_PASSWORD` matching
the separately provisioned `observed_catalog_reader`/`observed_catalog_writer`.
Setup never generates or rotates catalog passwords; changing an env value does not
change an installed ClickHouse user's password.

The catalog consumer detects table topology automatically; no quorum env setting
is needed. Plain `AggregatingMergeTree` tables need only their existing table
grants. For `ReplicatedAggregatingMergeTree`, also grant the writer these metadata
columns (use your actual writer name):

```sql
GRANT SELECT(database, table, total_replicas) ON system.replicas TO observed_catalog_writer;
```

Apply that grant on each replica when users are managed locally. It grants no
access to source spans. The ClickHouse endpoint must route to the same replication
group, with consistent catalog engines on every endpoint. Pause catalog writes
while changing that topology. Single replicas use synchronous local inserts;
multiple replicas retain automatic majority quorum. An unreadable or unsupported
topology stops the consumer without committing the Kafka record.

## 2. Pin a release

Each image is independently versioned. Include the collector release in `.env.production`:

| Variable                    | Image                                                                |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `FUTURE_AGI_VERSION`        | `futureagi/future-agi` (backend + worker)                            |
| `FRONTEND_VERSION`          | `futureagi/frontend`                                                 |
| `FI_COLLECTOR_VERSION`      | `futureagi/fi-collector` (collector, consumer and packaged backfill) |
| `AGENTCC_GATEWAY_VERSION`   | `futureagi/agentcc-gateway`                                          |
| `SERVING_VERSION`           | `futureagi/serving` (CPU; `<version>-gpu` is the CUDA build, amd64 only) |
| `CODE_EXECUTOR_VERSION`     | `futureagi/code-executor`                                            |
| `SIMULATION_RUNNER_VERSION` | `futureagi/future-agi-simulation-runner` (separate SDK worker image) |

Use reviewed release tags and record their verified registry digests, source SHAs
and CPU architecture manifests; a version-looking tag alone is not immutable proof.
Releases publish every image for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` (built natively)
except the `-gpu` serving variant. The serving image runs PyTorch on the CPU; on
GPU nodes pin `SERVING_VERSION=<version>-gpu` and reserve the GPU for the service.
`FUTURE_AGI_VERSION` names the default, feature-complete backend
(`futureagi/future-agi:<version>`: Debian's ffmpeg, git, the Vertex AI and
hosted-sandbox SDKs); its `-slim` tags are the base of Standalone's app image,
not for this overlay ([docs/images.md](../docs/images.md#backend-variants)).
Features that need a further optional extra are listed in
[INSTALLATION.md](../INSTALLATION.md#optional-feature-extras).
None of these image variables has a production fallback; missing/empty pins fail
configuration, including the simulation runner pin before its profile is enabled.
The backend pin covers bootstrap and ordinary workers; the SDK worker retains its
separate runner pin. Setup rejects collector `local`/`latest`, both
collector services select the same image, and the production overlay removes their
inherited build configuration. `up --no-build` additionally forbids source builds.
To pin image content, name the verified digest in the image reference through one
more Compose file (`image: futureagi/future-agi:<tag>@sha256:<digest>` per service; see
[docs/images.md](../docs/images.md#verifying-an-image)) rather than in the version
variables, which are also reported as the version in telemetry and licence activation.
No example tag or digest here is a qualified release. Backend, all applicable
workers and frontend must match the reviewed source; unchanged dependencies need
not be rebuilt. Keep these receipts for both fresh and retained-volume rehearsals.

The existing `FI_OBSERVED_CATALOG_MAX_KEYS_PER_SPAN` (default 128) and
`FI_OBSERVED_CATALOG_MAX_ARRAY_MEMBERS_PER_SPAN` (default 256) apply equally to
the collector and the packaged backfill invoked through the consumer service.
Set the same reviewed values in this env file; do not override them independently
for a repair run. These are extraction budgets, not tenant/activation settings.

## 3. Boot

```bash
docker compose --env-file deploy/.env.production \
  -f docker-compose.distributed.yml -f deploy/docker-compose.production.yml \
  pull
docker compose --env-file deploy/.env.production \
  -f docker-compose.distributed.yml -f deploy/docker-compose.production.yml \
  up -d --no-build --wait --wait-timeout 1200
```

Verify:

```bash
docker compose ps
curl -fsS http://localhost:3000/ > /dev/null && echo "frontend ok"
curl -fsS http://localhost:8000/health/ > /dev/null && echo "backend ok"
```

## Deployment topologies

The frontend image talks to backend via whatever URL you put in `VITE_HOST_API`. There is no in-container proxy — the browser calls the backend URL directly. Pick the shape:

### A. Split-domain

```
TLS proxy (Caddy/nginx)
   ├── app.example.com → frontend  (port 3000)
   └── api.example.com → backend   (port 8000)
```

Set `FRONTEND_URL=https://app.example.com` and `VITE_HOST_API=https://api.example.com`. Make sure backend's `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` includes `https://app.example.com`.

### B. Single-origin via reverse proxy route-split

```
TLS proxy (Caddy/nginx)
   app.example.com
     ├── /api/* → backend  (port 8000)
     └── /*    → frontend  (port 3000)
```

Set `VITE_HOST_API=/api` and let the proxy do the routing. Backend doesn't need CORS for cross-origin since SPA calls same origin.

On Kubernetes, use the [Helm chart](helm/futureagi/README.md) instead (`helm install futureagi oci://ghcr.io/future-agi/charts/futureagi --version X.Y.Z`, signed and published with every release): it covers the Gateway API and Ingress, TLS, external datastores, secrets, upgrades and backups.

## Reverse proxy + TLS

### Caddy

```
app.example.com {
    reverse_proxy localhost:3000
}
```

### nginx

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name app.example.com;
    ssl_certificate     /etc/letsencrypt/live/app.example.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/app.example.com/privkey.pem;
    client_max_body_size 1G;
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

## Backups

### Postgres

```bash
# nightly cron
0 2 * * * docker compose exec -T postgres \
  pg_dump -U futureagi futureagi | gzip > /backups/pg-$(date +\%F).sql.gz
```

Restore:

```bash
gunzip < pg-2026-05-07.sql.gz | docker compose exec -T postgres psql -U futureagi futureagi
```

### ClickHouse

Holds traces, evals, analytics — also irreplaceable. Use `clickhouse-backup` (recommended) or a per-table dump:

```bash
# Per-table dump (simple, blocks reads briefly)
docker compose exec -T clickhouse clickhouse-client \
  --query "BACKUP DATABASE default TO File('/var/lib/clickhouse/backups/$(date +%F)')"
```

For incremental backups to S3, see [`clickhouse-backup`](https://github.com/Altinity/clickhouse-backup).

### MinIO

For internal MinIO, configure `mc mirror` to an off-host bucket, or replace the bundled `minio` service with managed S3 (set `STORAGE_BACKEND=s3` and supply AWS creds).

## Upgrades

> Upgrading onto this release from one without the observed catalog is not just an
> image bump: read [Upgrading an existing install: backfill before you cut over](#upgrading-an-existing-install-backfill-before-you-cut-over)
> first, or every custom-attribute picker is empty for all history until you backfill.

```bash
# bump the relevant version variable(s) in deploy/.env.production
# (FUTURE_AGI_VERSION / FRONTEND_VERSION / FI_COLLECTOR_VERSION / AGENTCC_GATEWAY_VERSION /
#  SERVING_VERSION / CODE_EXECUTOR_VERSION / SIMULATION_RUNNER_VERSION)
docker compose --env-file deploy/.env.production \
  -f docker-compose.distributed.yml -f deploy/docker-compose.production.yml pull
docker compose --env-file deploy/.env.production \
  -f docker-compose.distributed.yml -f deploy/docker-compose.production.yml up -d --no-build --wait --wait-timeout 1200
```

Only use a separately rehearsed, compatible predecessor for rollback; restore its
exact image/configuration receipt after approval. Changing tags alone does not
undo schema/mirror changes or establish a healthy recovery. Preserve old data,
topics, volumes and obsolete workloads until their explicit retirement is approved.

**Retiring RabbitMQ.** The stack no longer runs RabbitMQ: Redis carries live
updates (the channel layer), and `RABBITMQ_USER`/`RABBITMQ_PASSWORD` are no
longer read. `up` leaves the old `rabbitmq` container running, because it
never removes containers of services the files no longer define. Once the upgraded
stack is healthy and its retirement is approved, remove it and, when you no longer
need its data, its volume (the prefix is your Compose project name):

```bash
docker compose --env-file deploy/.env.production \
  -f docker-compose.distributed.yml -f deploy/docker-compose.production.yml up -d --no-build --remove-orphans
docker volume rm futureagi_rabbitmq-data
```

## Pre-flight checklist

- [ ] `SECRET_KEY`, `AGENTCC_INTERNAL_API_KEY`, `AGENTCC_ADMIN_TOKEN` are 32+ random bytes
- [ ] `PG_PASSWORD`, `MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD` set to non-default values; `INTEGRATION_ENCRYPTION_KEY` set before connecting integrations
- [ ] Both catalog passwords match the provisioned identities; retained credentials were not rotated
- [ ] Check-only initialization prerequisite independently verified; no implicit production migrations or mirror repair
- [ ] Backend/workers/frontend and collector/consumer/backfill have matching source, registry digest and architecture receipts; `FI_COLLECTOR_VERSION` is explicit (not `local`/`latest`); remaining image versions are pinned
- [ ] `FRONTEND_URL` matches the public URL behind your reverse proxy, and `APP_URL` is the same URL (invite and password-reset links; unset, they point at `localhost:3000`)
- [ ] `VITE_HOST_API` matches the public backend URL (or `/api` if route-split at the proxy)
- [ ] Backend CORS allows the frontend origin (split-domain only)
- [ ] Reverse proxy terminates TLS; frontend container is not exposed publicly on port 3000
- [ ] `code-executor` is running and reachable from the backend and workers; `CODE_EXECUTOR_LOCAL_FALLBACK` is unset or `false`
- [ ] Postgres, ClickHouse, MinIO data volumes are on persistent storage
- [ ] Backup crons (Postgres + ClickHouse) scheduled and tested with restore dry-run
- [ ] Docker daemon and host OS get security patches on a known cadence
- [ ] The rest of the [minimal production checklist](../docs/configuration.md#minimal-production-checklist) holds: `ENV_TYPE=production`, public URLs, locked-down origins, email or share-by-link invites
- [ ] `OSS_RETURN_PASSWORD_RESET_LINK` is unset or `false`
- [ ] Telemetry decided: left on, or `FUTURE_AGI_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=true` ([what is sent](../docs/telemetry.md))
