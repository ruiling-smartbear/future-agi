# Testing

Future AGI's testing pipeline runs in three layers, each catching a different class of problem before the next:

```
Developer machine     →     Git hooks     →     GitHub Actions
─────────────────           ─────────────       ───────────────
Run what you changed        Fast feedback       Full test suite
(yarn / make / bin/test)    (lint-staged)       (per-branch workflows)
```

Frontend, backend, and the Go collector have independent test runners. Run the suites affected by your change.

- Frontend-specific conventions: [`frontend/TESTING.md`](frontend/TESTING.md)
- Backend runner internals: `futureagi/bin/test --help`
- Branch naming (enforced on push): [`BRANCH_NAMING_CONVENTION.md`](BRANCH_NAMING_CONVENTION.md)

---

## Running tests locally

### Frontend (React + Vite, Vitest + React Testing Library)

```bash
cd frontend

yarn test                # Interactive watch mode
yarn test:run            # One-shot run
yarn test:changed        # Only tests related to changed files
yarn test:coverage       # Full run with coverage report
yarn test:unit           # Unit tests only
yarn test:integration    # Integration tests only
yarn test:api-journeys   # Browserless API journeys against a running backend
```

Coverage thresholds (global): **70%** for branches, functions, lines, and statements.

API journeys require `API_BASE` plus either `FUTURE_AGI_ACCESS_TOKEN` or
`FUTURE_AGI_EMAIL`/`FUTURE_AGI_PASSWORD`. Mutating annotation coverage is opt-in
with `API_JOURNEY_MUTATIONS=1`.

### Backend (Django + pytest, Compose dependencies)

```bash
cd futureagi

uv sync --frozen         # once, and after dependency changes (CI adds --all-extras)
make test                # All tests
make test-unit           # Unit tests
make test-integration    # Integration tests
make test-watch          # Watch mode
make test-shell          # Interactive test shell
```

Under the hood, `make test` delegates to `bin/test`, which runs pytest with the local Python environment and starts dependencies in `docker-compose.test.yml` (Postgres, Redis, ClickHouse, and MinIO). See `bin/test --help` for lower-level options. The project name is fixed to `futureagi-test`; coordinate ownership before using it alongside another checkout.

### Collector and deployment contracts

Do **not** run the full collector suite on a shared host: it includes fixed-port
listeners and environment-gated integration writers. Run the Go test command
below only in a fresh, disposable **network-none network namespace** with its
own loopback, no host networking or published ports, and an explicit environment
allowlist excluding ambient `OBS_TEST_*` and `CH_TEST_*` variables. Do not enable
the `integration` build tag in this unit lane. Prepare dependencies separately;
do not give test execution external network access.

```bash
# Full suite: inside the isolated namespace described above, never on the host.
(cd fi-collector && go test -race -count=1 ./...)
(cd fi-collector && go build ./cmd/fi-collector ./cmd/fi-property-catalog-consumer ./cmd/fi-observed-catalog-backfill)
python3 -m unittest discover -s deploy/tests -p 'test_observed_catalog_*.py' -v
python3 -m unittest discover -s deploy/tests -p 'test_image_size_budget.py' -v
```

Report environment-gated integration skips separately from executed unit tests;
they do not qualify real ClickHouse/Kafka/PostgreSQL behavior. A non-race binary
run is not race qualification. Targeted in-memory/transport-only tests may run
directly under deny-all networking. Tests using `miniredis` or `httptest` need
only their own loopback listeners, never borrowed host services.

The deployment suite renders the Standalone, Distributed, development, E2E and production Compose files, checks the startup dependency graph and mutation guards, and exercises index bootstrap with a fake ClickHouse client. It does not start containers or create databases. Passing configuration tests is not a fresh/retained startup proof. Runtime observation validation uses the existing E2E harness; see [`fi-collector/PROPERTY_CATALOG_OSS.md`](fi-collector/PROPERTY_CATALOG_OSS.md) for source-built images and the bounded backfill command.

The installer suite, `futureagi/tests/test_oss_install_hardening.py` and `futureagi/tests/test_oss_install_env.py`, runs `bin/install` and `bin/uninstall` against stub `docker`, `curl` and `date` commands, so it needs no Docker daemon. It covers setup selection (Standalone, Distributed, an older Distributed install), the refusals that keep an install on its setup, fresh-install secrets, the preflight checks, the readiness loop and `--purge` scoping. It does not prove that either setup boots; `./bin/install --from-source` on a branch does.

The installers' bring-up block is also executed on its own, against a Compose double, in `deploy/tests/test_observed_catalog_startup.py` (bash, and PowerShell when `pwsh` is installed): each setup makes exactly one `compose up` call (Distributed a bounded `up --build --wait`, Standalone a plain `up -d`), never retries or cleans up, and an upgraded Distributed install names its retired RabbitMQ container without removing it.

### Image sizes

Every image has a compressed-size budget in [`scripts/image_size_budget.json`](scripts/image_size_budget.json), per architecture, and so does what a fresh Standalone install downloads (the app image plus Postgres and ClickHouse, each layer counted once). Per-image budgets and measured sizes are summarized in [`docs/images.md`](docs/images.md#images-at-a-glance). `scripts/image_size_budget.py` reads the sizes from registry manifests, so it needs no Docker daemon:

```bash
# Every image of a release, both architectures:
python3 scripts/image_size_budget.py report --tag v1.42.0
# One image you pushed to a registry (sizes are compressed layers, which a
# local `docker build` does not have until it is pushed; CI pushes to a
# throwaway localhost:5000 registry):
python3 scripts/image_size_budget.py check --image futureagi/platform --arch amd64 \
  --ref localhost:5000/futureagi/platform:ci --baseline futureagi/platform:latest --default-install
```

CI runs `check` on pull requests (`platform-ci.yml`, for the images it builds) and on every release build before any tag moves (`build-image-multiarch.yml`). It also prints the upgrade delta: the bytes an existing install downloads to move from `:latest` to the new image, which stays small only while the release build cache hits. A change that needs a bigger image raises its budget in the same pull request, with the reason. `deploy/tests/test_image_size_budget.py` tests the script against a fake registry and checks that every image the compose files and `release-images.yml` use has a budget.

### Images, docs and the Helm chart

These suites read files and need no Docker daemon and no services:

```bash
# Every deployment suite: Compose contracts, installer bring-up, production setup,
# image conventions (docs/images.md), Standalone's first-run page and boot summary.
python3 -m unittest discover -s deploy/tests -v

# Docs that must match the code, from futureagi/ in its virtualenv (uv sync --frozen):
#   docs/configuration.md documents every ${VAR} of the compose files and every .env.example key;
#   docs/telemetry.md lists every field telemetry sends and every FUTURE_AGI_TELEMETRY_* setting;
#   every setup-check link points at a heading of INSTALLATION.md.
cd futureagi && .venv/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_env_reference.py \
  tfc/deployment_telemetry/tests/test_docs_contract.py \
  "tfc/tests/test_setup_checks.py::TestCheckInventory"
```

So renaming a heading of `INSTALLATION.md` under **Troubleshooting**, adding
a compose variable without a row in `docs/configuration.md`, or sending a new
telemetry field without documenting it fails a test.
`python3 scripts/env_reference.py` lists the compose variables
`docs/configuration.md` does not document yet.

`deploy/tests/test_image_standards.py` checks every Dockerfile's conventions
and the release workflows (both backend variants, the size budgets); CI runs it
in `fi-collector-ci.yml`. Its two workflow tests need PyYAML and are skipped
without it. To check a built backend image's contents,
`scripts/verify-image-contents.sh` takes `OSS_VARIANT=standard|slim` (a tag
ending in `-slim` means slim). Standalone builds by `./bin/install --from-source`
and `./bin/dev` are slim, so pass `OSS_VARIANT=slim` for them.

The Helm chart has its own checks (they need `helm`, `kubeconform` and Python
with PyYAML; the kind smoke test also needs `kind`, `kubectl` and images built
from this checkout):

```bash
deploy/helm/futureagi/hack/check.sh                  # lint, template, kubeconform, invariants, values docs and schema
TAG=local deploy/helm/futureagi/hack/kind-smoke.sh   # install, check, upgrade and roll back on kind
deploy/helm/futureagi/hack/package.sh --no-digests --destination dist   # build the release package locally
```

`check.sh` renders every value set, `ci/overrides.yaml` included, checks that
inconsistent values (reCAPTCHA without its key) refuse to render, and runs
`hack/rendered_checks.py` over the manifests: no duplicate or forward-referenced
env variables, the public URLs per value set, `$(POD_IP)` in a restricted
`ALLOWED_HOSTS`, worker migration gating, open ports for exposed Services, the
gateway's port, and load balancer health checks (GKE HealthCheckPolicies, ALB
annotations) that probe what the readiness probes probe. It checks that the
install notes and `hack/support-bundle.sh` keep credentials (proxy logins,
passwords in URLs) out, and that `.prettierignore` keeps the pre-commit
formatter off the templates and the files `values_docs.py` writes.
`KUBE_VERSIONS` picks the Kubernetes versions kubeconform validates against
(CI: `1.27.0 1.37.0`), and `CRD_SCHEMAS` a mirror of the CRD schema catalog
for the Gateway API, GKE, External Secrets, Argo CD and Flux kinds when CI has
no network. `kind-smoke.sh` also checks
that a resize of a bundled datastore's volume is refused and that
`helm rollback` restores the chart's Secret.

The chart is published by `helm-release.yml`, not by hand: at a `vX.Y.Z` tag,
after the images exist, it packages the chart with the images' digests
(`hack/package.sh`), runs `check.sh` on the package with Helm 3 and Helm 4,
installs it on kind with the published images, then pushes it to
`oci://ghcr.io/future-agi/charts/futureagi`, signs it with cosign, attests its
provenance and attaches it to the GitHub Release. If any step fails, the images
stay published and the chart is withheld; re-run the workflow from the tag
(Use workflow from: `vX.Y.Z`, version `vX.Y.Z`) for a transient failure. A
published version is never pushed again.

### Observed catalog integration (isolated dependencies)

After confirming ports 18143, 19094 and 15543 are free and choosing a unique
project name, start only the three-service fixture from the repository root:

```bash
OBS_TEST_PROJECT="observed-catalog-local-$$"
docker compose --env-file /dev/null \
  -f fi-collector/test/observed-catalog/compose.yml \
  -p "$OBS_TEST_PROJECT" up -d --wait --wait-timeout 180

(cd fi-collector && \
  OBS_TEST_CH_URL=http://127.0.0.1:18143 \
  OBS_TEST_KAFKA_BROKER=127.0.0.1:19094 \
  OBS_TEST_PG_DSN=postgres://test:test@127.0.0.1:15543/observed_catalog_test \
  OBS_TEST_REPLICA_URLS='' GOMAXPROCS=2 \
  go test -race -count=1 -p 1 -timeout 8m -v \
    -run '^(TestClickHouse|TestKafka|TestPostgres|TestBackfillCLIThroughKafkaWithResume|TestObservedCatalogHTTPToLocalStack)' \
    ./cmd/fi-observed-catalog-backfill ./pkg/server)

# Only when finished with this disposable project you created:
docker compose --env-file /dev/null \
  -f fi-collector/test/observed-catalog/compose.yml \
  -p "$OBS_TEST_PROJECT" down --volumes --remove-orphans --timeout 10
```

For an already-running fixture owned by another task, run only the Go command
with its confirmed ports; do not start or tear down that project. Override
`OBS_TEST_CH_PORT`, `OBS_TEST_KAFKA_PORT`, `OBS_TEST_PG_PORT` and the matching
Go endpoints together if the defaults are occupied.

CI uses the same fixture, repeats OSS bootstrap, requires all ten integration
proofs to pass (missing/skipped tests fail), captures logs, and always cleans up
its unique run/attempt project. The HTTP test covers parsing, trusted scope,
async source write, spool restart, Kafka and index consumption; authentication
is a synthetic trusted result, not live PostgreSQL API-key authentication.
Three-replica qualification remains optional via `replicated.yml` and
`OBS_TEST_REPLICA_URLS`, outside the default CI job.

### End-to-end (browser + Distributed setup, Playwright)

```bash
bin/e2e up      # boot the isolated futureagi-e2e stack (side by side with your dev stack)
bin/e2e test    # run the Playwright suite against it
bin/e2e ui      # Playwright UI mode
bin/e2e down    # stop it (add -v to wipe volumes)
```

End-to-end flows that drive a real browser against the production frontend image and assert both what the user sees **and** the backend state behind it (Postgres, ClickHouse, the CDC mirrors). The stack is the Distributed setup, `docker-compose.distributed.yml`, trimmed and moved onto its own ports (app 3100, API 8100, everything else 2xxxx), with separate default ports from dev and `futureagi-test`. The project name is fixed to `futureagi-e2e`; check ownership and ports before startup. The only mocked component is the LLM provider, behind the real gateway.

A cold first boot takes about 8–9 minutes — most of it the backend's first-run migrations — and warm boots are far quicker. Covered flows are cataloged in [`e2e/FLOWS.md`](e2e/FLOWS.md), which is generated from the specs (`cd e2e && yarn catalog`). The authoring guide, the attach and local-code workflows, and the quarantine rules are in [`e2e/README.md`](e2e/README.md). Two agent skills ship with the repo: `writing-e2e-flows` authors a flow from the feature's ticket and design doc, and `reviewing-prs` reviews a PR against the coding standards with an E2E-coverage gate (`cd e2e && yarn coverage`).

## Git hooks

Installed once per clone via `yarn install` at repo root (husky's `prepare` script wires `core.hooksPath=.husky/`).

### `pre-commit` (`.husky/pre-commit`)

Runs `lint-staged` against files currently staged. For frontend paths that means ESLint auto-fix + Prettier; Python formatting runs separately via `make pre-commit-install` inside `futureagi/`.

The hook auto-skips during `git merge` — merge-commit staging includes the entire merge diff, which makes linting every file pointless and slow.

### `pre-push` (`.husky/pre-push`)

Validates the branch name against the convention in `BRANCH_NAMING_CONVENTION.md`. Protected branches (`main`, `master`, `dev`, `develop`) skip validation. Applies to both frontend and backend commits.

### Bypassing hooks

Only in genuine emergencies, and document _why_ in the commit body:

```bash
git commit --no-verify -m "hotfix: critical bug"
git push --no-verify
```

If `--no-verify` becomes habitual, the hook is wrong — open an issue instead.

## CI (GitHub Actions)

CI covers frontend, sharded backend pytest, Go collector tests/builds, deployment contracts, and the end-to-end suite. Workflows in [`.github/workflows/`](.github/workflows):

| Workflow                           | Trigger                                                                          | Purpose                                                                                            |

| `fi-collector-ci.yml`             | Collector/deployment PR changes (and Dockerfiles), pushes to `dev`/`main`, merge queue, manual | Go race tests/builds, real observation integration, Compose/bootstrap contracts, image conventions (`test_image_standards.py`) and installer syntax |
| `e2e-ci.yml`                       | PRs into and pushes on `dev`/`main`, merge queue                                 | Builds the changed images from PR code, boots the `futureagi-e2e` stack, runs the Playwright flows |
| `platform-ci.yml`                  | PRs into and pushes on `dev`/`main` that touch the Standalone setup or the backend | Builds the five Standalone images, the backend as its slim variant (amd64; arm64 when dependencies or Dockerfiles change), checks their size budgets, runs `./bin/install` and smoke-tests the Standalone stack |
| `helm-ci.yml`                      | PRs into and pushes on `dev`/`main` that touch `deploy/helm/**`, the bootstrap command or the release-please files | `hack/check.sh` (lint, template, kubeconform on Kubernetes 1.27 and 1.37, rendered invariants, values docs and schema) with Helm 3.22 and Helm 4.3, on the chart and on its package (`hack/package.sh`); fails on a subchart or a Bitnami image, and when the chart's `version` or `appVersion` drifts from the release manifest; then installs the chart on kind with bundled datastores and runs `hack/kind-smoke.sh`, including an in-place upgrade and a rollback |
| `release-images.yml`               | a `vX.Y.Z` tag                                                                   | Builds every image natively for amd64 and arm64 (the backend in both variants: the default tags and `-slim`), checks each against its size budget, then tags it; publishes the pinned code-executor base when it is new; then calls `helm-release.yml` for the chart |
| `helm-release.yml`                 | called by `release-images.yml` at a `vX.Y.Z` tag once its images exist; manual retry from the tag | Packages the chart with the images' digests, checks the package with Helm 3 and 4, installs it on kind with the published images, pushes it to GHCR (never over a published version), signs it with cosign, attests its provenance, attaches it to the GitHub Release with the images lock, the Hauler manifest and `support-bundle.sh`, and pushes the Artifact Hub metadata |
| `base-digest-check.yml`            | weekly, manual                                                                   | Fails when a digest-pinned base image (e.g. `python:3.11-slim-bookworm`) has moved, listing the new digest |

A push to a feature branch runs only `frontend-feature.yml`, not the main or develop pipelines. This keeps GitHub Actions minutes targeted — no overlapping workflows.

## Test layout

### Frontend

Tests live next to the components they test, or under per-feature `__tests__/` folders:

```
frontend/src/
├── components/Button/
│   ├── Button.jsx
│   └── Button.test.jsx        ← component-local tests
└── __tests__/
    ├── unit/                  ← fast, isolated (ideal for pre-commit)
    ├── integration/           ← component + deps (CI)
    └── e2e/                   ← end-to-end (CI only, not yet running)
```

Custom render helper: `frontend/src/utils/test-utils.jsx` wraps providers (Theme, Settings, Router) — use it instead of `@testing-library/react`'s bare `render()`.

### Backend

Tests live inside each Django app:

```
futureagi/
├── tracer/tests/
├── agentic_eval/tests/
├── simulate/tests/
├── mcp_server/tests/
└── accounts/tests/
```

pytest discovers them automatically. Use `bin/test path/to/tests/test_foo.py::test_bar` when you need granular selection.

---

## Troubleshooting

**Hooks don't fire after cloning.** Run `yarn install` at repo root — husky's `prepare` script sets `core.hooksPath` during install, and it's a no-op until that runs.

**Pre-commit fails on files you didn't touch.** `lint-staged` only runs against _your_ staged files, so this usually means you accidentally staged more than intended. Check `git diff --cached --stat`.

**Tests pass locally but fail in CI.** Run `yarn test:ci` (frontend) or `make test` (backend) — both use the same reporter/environment as CI.

**Backend test dependencies are stuck.** Inspect `bin/test status` and `bin/test logs` first. `bin/test down` removes the `futureagi-test` volumes; use it only for a disposable test stack you own, never to free resources used by another checkout.

**TypeScript errors block a commit.** Frontend doesn't currently ship a `tsconfig.json`, so `yarn type-check` is a no-op. If someone adds TypeScript, that gate starts working automatically.

---

## What we're still missing

- Broader E2E flow coverage — the harness and CI job ship today; [`e2e/FLOWS.md`](e2e/FLOWS.md) is the current list
- Visual regression testing (Chromatic or Percy)
- Accessibility testing (axe-core in CI)
- Performance budgets with automated alerts

Contributions welcome — open an issue before starting work on any of these so we can align on scope.
